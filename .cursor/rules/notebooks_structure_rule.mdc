# Jupyter Notebooks Structure

The data analysis workflow is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, located in the `huiju_ecommerce_analysis/notebooks/` directory. Each notebook serves a specific purpose in the analysis pipeline:

*   `00_project_setup_and_data_overview.ipynb`: Handles initial project environment setup, library imports, and a first look at the dataset (loading, basic info, descriptive statistics).
*   `01_data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: Focuses on data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and any necessary preprocessing steps.
*   `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Contains the main exploratory data analysis (EDA), including univariate and multivariate analysis to uncover initial insights and patterns.
*   `03_user_segmentation_analysis.ipynb`: Dives deeper into user segmentation based on demographics, purchase behavior, and other relevant features.
*   `04_product_category_analysis.ipynb`: Specifically analyzes product categories, sales performance, user preferences for different categories, and potential cross-category relationships.
*   `05_conclusions_and_recommendations.ipynb`: Summarizes the key findings from all analyses and formulates actionable business recommendations for the "惠聚" platform.
